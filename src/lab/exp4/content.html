The main focus of this lab is to introduce the concept of data capturing by the sensors. It discusses about the term “spatial resolution” and how this varies depending on the altitude and the type of sensor.

Suppose you are looking at a forested hillside some considerable distance away. What you see is the presence of the continuous forest but at a great distance you do not see individual trees. As you go closer, eventually the trees, which may differ in size, shape, and species, become distinct as individuals. They have thus been resolved. As you draw much nearer, you start to see individual leaves. This means that the main components of an individual entity are now discernible and thus that category is being resolved. You can carry this ever further, through leaf macro-structure, then recognition of cells, and in principle with higher resolutions the individual constituent atoms and finally subatomic components. This last step is the highest resolution (related to the smallest sizes) achievable by instruments or sensors. All of these levels represent the "ability to recognize and separate features of specific sizes".

For some remote sensing instruments, the distance between the target being imaged and the platform, plays a large role in determining the detail of information obtained and the total area imaged by the sensor. Sensors onboard platforms far away from their targets, typically view a larger area, but cannot provide great detail. Compare what an astronaut onboard the space shuttle sees of the Earth to what you can see from an airplane. The astronaut might see your whole province or country in one glance, but couldn't distinguish individual houses. Flying over a city or town, you would be able to see individual buildings and cars, but you would be viewing a much smaller area than the astronaut.</p>
<table margin-left="25px" >
<tr>
<td width ="70%"><p>The detail discernible in an image is dependent on the spatial resolution of the sensor and refers to the size of the smallest possible feature that can be detected. Spatial resolution of sensors depends primarily on their Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV).The IFOV is the angular cone of visibility of the sensor (A) and determines the area on the Earth's surface which is "seen" from a given altitude at one particular moment in time (B). The size of the area viewed is determined by multiplying the IFOV by the distance from the ground to the sensor (C). This area on the ground is called the resolution cell and determines a sensor's maximum spatial resolution. For a homogeneous feature to be detected, its size generally has to be equal to or larger than the resolution cell. If the feature is smaller than this, it may not be detectable as the average brightness of all features in that resolution cell will be recorded. However, smaller features may sometimes be detectable if their reflectance dominates within a articular resolution cell allowing sub-pixel or resolution cell detection. </p></td>
